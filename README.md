# Exploratory Analysis of Rating Data for Various Movies by Internet Users with Python

> Status: Concluded

I got the data for this project from MovieLens. The site hosts variations of this data that can be downloaded under license. The project was made in Google Colaboratory.
*Step by step:
- I used the pandas library to analyze the notes in general and the seaborn library to present the data in a visual way.
- I used the pandas library to view the dataframe with the movies.
- I used the pandas library to analyze specific notes per movie, but this time I used the pyplot module from the matplotlib library, in addition to the seaborn library to present the data in a visual way.
- Using the same database and adding the numpy library to the libraries I was already using, I did a brief review of central tendency measures, dispersion measures, and some visualizations such as box plot and histogram.
